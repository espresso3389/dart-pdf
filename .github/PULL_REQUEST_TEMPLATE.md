- [ ] `fvm flutter pub get`
- [ ] `fvm dart analyze`
- [ ] `cd packages/pdf_cos && fvm dart test`
- [ ] `cd packages/pdf_document && fvm dart test`
- [ ] `cd packages/pdf_graphics && fvm dart test`

## PDF fixtures and screenshots

<!--
Attach minimal PDFs, screenshots, or before/after images when they help review.
Do not upload private or confidential PDFs. Prefer programmatic fixtures in
tests, or minimized documents that reproduce the behavior.
-->

## Compatibility checklist

- [ ] No `dart:ui` or Flutter imports outside `packages/dart_pdf_editor`.
- [ ] No `dart:io` imports in any `lib/` directory.
- [ ] Layering is preserved: `pdf_cos` <- `pdf_document` <- `pdf_graphics` <- `dart_pdf_editor`.
- [ ] Parsers remain lenient on real-world input and writers remain strict on output.
- [ ] Raw PDF stream bytes stay lazy/raw until decoding is required.
- [ ] Test fixtures use builders/programmatic generation instead of hand-edited byte offsets.

## Notes for reviewers

<!-- Known limitations, intentional baseline changes, migration notes, or follow-up work. -->
