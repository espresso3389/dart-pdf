# dart-pdf — pure-Dart PDF renderer & editor

Monorepo using **pub workspaces** (root `pubspec.yaml` lists members under
`packages/`). Flutter is managed with **fvm** (see `.fvmrc`); use
`fvm flutter` / `fvm dart`, or the binaries in `~/fvm/versions/3.44.0/bin/`.

## Commands

- `fvm flutter pub get` (at repo root — resolves every workspace package)
- `fvm dart analyze` (at root)
- `cd packages/<pkg> && fvm dart test` (pure-Dart packages)
- `cd packages/pdf_flutter && fvm flutter test`

## Layering rules (strict)

`pdf_cos` ← `pdf_document` ← `pdf_graphics` ← `pdf_flutter`

- `dart:ui` and Flutter imports are **only** allowed in `pdf_flutter`.
  Everything else must run on the Dart VM (server/CLI/tests) and on the web.
- `dart:io` is not allowed anywhere in `lib/` (web support); use
  `package:archive` for compression.
- `pdf_cos` knows nothing about pages or rendering — only the COS object
  model, syntax, filters, xref, and (de)serialization.

## Design conventions

- Parsers are lenient on input (real-world PDFs are broken: wrong /Length,
  missing endobj, junk before header) and strict on output.
- Streams stay as raw byte views (`Uint8List.sublistView`) until decoded;
  objects load lazily through the xref.
- `CosDictionary` is keyed by `String` (name without the slash).
- Test fixtures are built programmatically in `test/fixtures.dart` so byte
  offsets are always correct — don't hand-edit offsets.

## Test corpus

`corpus/` (git-ignored) holds ~50 real-world PDFs copied from Ben's local
folders and OneDrive — CAD drawings, scanned docs, reports, forms. Use them
to validate changes:

- Parse check: `cd packages/pdf_document && fvm dart tool/inspect.dart ../../corpus/*.pdf`
- Render check: `cd packages/pdf_flutter && PDF_PATH=../../corpus/<file>.pdf PDF_PAGE=0 fvm flutter test test/render_smoke_test.dart` (writes /tmp/dart_pdf_render.png)

## Roadmap context

See README.md. The pipeline through the viewer is done: interpreter, font
engine, Flutter rendering, text selection/search, annotation appearance
rendering, and encryption both ways (RC4/AES-128/AES-256 decryption;
encrypt-on-write re-encrypts changed objects on save — `_encryptedCopy`
in updater.dart; signing encrypted files stays refused). Annotation authoring is in:
`PdfEditor` creates highlights/ink/shapes/free text/notes/stamps with
generated appearance streams (`annotation_editor.dart`) and can flatten
them into page content. AcroForm support is in: `PdfAcroForm`/`PdfFormField`
model (`form.dart`) plus filling with regenerated appearances
(`form_editor.dart` — text/checkbox/radio/choice, auto-size, quadding).
Page manipulation is in (`page_editor.dart`): reorder/move/remove flatten
the page tree (materializing inherited attributes), `appendPagesFrom`
deep-copies pages across documents, `extractPages` splits into a fresh
file via `CosDocumentBuilder` (pdf_cos's from-scratch writer).
Digital signatures are in: `PdfSignature.of(doc)` + `validate()`
(`signature.dart`; CMS/X.509/RSA/ECDSA primitives live in
`pdf_cos/src/crypto/` — asn1, rsa, ecdsa, cms) and `PdfEditor.saveSigned`
(`signature_editor.dart`, adbe.pkcs7.detached with ByteRange patching).
No trust-store chain validation. Test signer identity in
`pdf_test_fixtures/src/signer_identity.dart`.
Content editing is in: `PdfEditor.stampPage` (text/shapes/JPEG via
`PdfStamp`), `PdfPageElements.of` + `PdfEditor.deleteElements` (element
enumeration with approximate bounds, stream rewriting), and
`PdfEditor.replaceText` (simple fonts only) — all in
`content_editor.dart`/`content_elements.dart`; the content-stream
tokenizer (`ContentStreamParser`) now lives in pdf_cos.
The roadmap is complete. Polish landed since: LZW/RunLength filters, xref recovery
(`CosDocument.open` falls back to scanning for `N G obj` when the xref
chain is broken), type 4 PostScript calculator functions, /Count-based
page lookup with full-walk fallback, gradient /Extend semantics, JPEG
/Decode + color-key masks, and /Rotate folded into `PdfPageGeometry`
(selection, highlights, overlays, and hit-testing are rotation-aware;
the geometry mirrors the renderer's canvas transform).
The big-gap batch landed next, all KAT-validated against reference
codecs: encrypt-on-write (updater `_encryptedCopy`; signing encrypted
files still refused), trust-store chain validation
(`verifyCertificateChain` in pdf_cos cms.dart, `PdfTrustStore` +
`validate(trustStore:)` in pdf_document), mesh shadings 4-7
(`PdfMeshParser`/`PdfMesh`, device `fillMesh`, drawVertices in
pdf_flutter), CCITT G3/G4 (`CcittDecoder`, KAT vs libtiff), JBIG2
embedded profile (`Jbig2Decoder` + shared `MqDecoder` in
filters/mq.dart, KAT vs jbig2enc/jbig2dec), JPEG 2000 (`JpxDecoder`,
lossless bit-perfect vs OpenJPEG, lossy ±1), deep-zoom detail patch
(`PdfPageView` renders the visible slice past the raster caps;
`rasterizeRegion`), and real ICC (`IccProfile` in pdf_graphics —
gray TRC, matrix/TRC, mft1/mft2/mAB LUTs, validated vs littleCMS;
wired into sc/scn and image decoding). Remaining gaps: text reflow,
RSASSA-PSS, JBIG2 Huffman/refinement, JPX subsampling + PCRL/CPRL,
rendering intents/BPC in ICC.
The editing UI is in (pdf_flutter `src/editing/`): `PdfEditingController`
owns the edit session — every edit is an incremental save, so revisions
are byte prefixes of one buffer and undo/redo is a stack of lengths;
`PdfViewer(editing:)` injects per-page tool overlays (markup/ink/shapes/
free text/note/stamp; select + move + resize via
`PdfEditor.resizeAnnotation`, which rewrites /Rect and scales the point
arrays — appearances stretch per §12.5.5), binds undo/redo/delete/escape
shortcuts, and preserves the viewport across same-geometry document
swaps. `PdfEditingToolbar` is the stock chrome. The host must rebuild
the viewer with `editing.document` whenever the controller notifies
(asserted in debug builds); the example app shows the wiring.
On top of that: style controls (controller carries strokeWidth/opacity/
fontSize; the toolbar's tune button opens a slider popup), an
annotation sidebar (`PdfAnnotationSidebar` — lists by page, tap selects
via `selectAnnotation(page, slot)`, trailing delete), and a content
tool (`PdfEditTool.content`: taps hit-test `PdfPageElements` — cached
per revision in the controller — orange selection chrome; delete via
`deleteElements`, text rewrite via `replaceText`; element ids die with
every revision, so any edit clears the element selection).
Page management UI: `PdfThumbnailSidebar` (editing_thumbnails.dart) —
display-list thumbnails (`renderPicture` replayed scaled, no
rasterization), tap to jump, long-press drag to reorder
(ReorderableListView `onReorderItem` — already index-adjusted), footer
delete; `controller.movePage`/`removePage` clear the slot-based
annotation selection first because page indices shift under it, and
`removePage` is a no-op on the last page.
